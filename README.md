Hi! I'm Kevin!

At the moment I mainly focuns on improving my abilities as a Webdeveloper.
I mostly enjoy working on Frontend problems and learning about new ways to make my Projects look exactly how I envisioned them.
My main Goal at the moment is to finish TOP(www.theodinproject.com) and teach myself a solid foundation to build upon.
If you think I might be a good fit for an intersting opportunity, or just have some advice in general, then don't mind reaching out to me.
